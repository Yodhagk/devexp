Define the data structure: Determine the structure of the data you want to store in your MySQL database. This will involve identifying the different types of expenses, such as travel expenses or office expenses, and the fields associated with each expense type.

Create the MySQL database: Use a tool like phpMyAdmin to create the database and tables that will store your expense data.

Build the HTML form: Create an HTML form that allows users to input their expense data. The form should include fields for each expense type and any associated data.

Connect to the database: Use PHP to connect to the MySQL database and insert the data submitted through the HTML form.

Create the report page: Build a PHP page that retrieves the expense data from the MySQL database and displays it in an organized, easy-to-read format. This may involve sorting the data by date, expense type, or another relevant field.

Apply filters and search functionality: Add filters and search functionality to the report page so users can easily find specific expenses or view expenses within a certain time period.

Implement security measures: Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the MySQL database and protect sensitive expense data.

Test and refine: Test the HTML and PHP code to ensure it functions as expected and refine as necessary based on user feedback or issues that arise.

Deploy and maintain: Deploy the digital expenses report to a web server and ensure it is maintained and updated as needed.
